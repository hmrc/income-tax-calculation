# income-tax-calculation

This is where we make Downstream calls to initiate a calculation of a user's tax return, and to declare that they wish to crystallise/submit their return. We can also use Calculation to retrieve the Business Details of a particular NINO, required for the valid tax year list session values used across the service. Income Tax View and Change also call down to this repo for some requests.

## Running the service locally

You will need to have the following:
- Installed/configured [service manager](https://github.com/hmrc/service-manager).

The service manager profile for this service is:

    sm --start INCOME_TAX_CALCULATION_VC
Run the following command to start the remaining services locally:

    sudo mongod (If not already running)
    sm --start INCOME_TAX_SUBMISSION_ALL -r

This service runs on port: `localhost:9314`
